🔥 Reverse Engineering Agent Tesla Malware
🛠️ About This Project
This repository provides a comprehensive reverse engineering analysis of Agent Tesla, a sophisticated Remote Access Trojan (RAT) and spyware. First detected in 2014, Agent Tesla has evolved from a simple keylogger to a powerful malware capable of:

Credential theft (email clients, browsers, VPNs, FTP apps)
Keylogging & screenshot capture
Data exfiltration (via HTTP, SMTP, FTP, Telegram)
Remote system control
Advanced anti-analysis techniques
Using static and dynamic analysis, this project uncovers its obfuscation methods, persistence mechanisms, and communication protocols.

📌 Key Findings
✔ Uses AutoIt for packing & obfuscation
✔ Modifies registry keys for persistence
✔ Intercepts and exfiltrates credentials
✔ Communicates with C2 servers via HTTP, SMTP, FTP, Telegram
✔ Employs anti-VM & anti-debugging techniques

🧑‍💻 Methodology
This analysis was conducted using both static and dynamic analysis techniques.

🔹 Static Analysis Tools: VirusTotal, PEStudio, dnSpy, AutoIt Extractor
🔹 Dynamic Analysis Tools: ProcMon, RegShot, Process Explorer, PESieve

🔐 Recommendations
🔹 Use advanced behavioral analysis to detect suspicious activities
🔹 Deploy phishing protection to block malicious emails
🔹 Keep software updated to prevent exploitation
🔹 Monitor network traffic for anomalies and block C2 communication
